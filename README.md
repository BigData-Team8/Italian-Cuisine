Italian Cuisine & Regional Clusters: A Big Data System from data collection to end-user recommendations

This project has the ultimate goal of creating a map of Italian regional recipes and, on through this, return suggestions to the user on regional recipes that can be prepared on the basis of provided ingredients. A pipeline has been structured, starting from the data collection and ingestion, passing through the data preparation and EDA, ending with a Web platform (and an API) that we structured as the serving layer. The aim is therefore to exploit the information provided by the collected recipes and add value, through a prediction of regionality and a personalized response.

PLease, go to the wiki section for the complete documentation.
